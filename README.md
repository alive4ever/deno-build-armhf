# deno build for linux-armhf

## Introduction

There is no build of `deno`, the js runtime for `armhf` platform. Here is my attempt to provide `deno` build for those who uses an armhf device, such as many cheap tv boxes or Raspberry Pi 1/Zero.

## How to use

Just grab the resulting tgz or deb package from the releases page and install it. Optionally, verify the checksum to ensure the file integrity.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to upstream `deno`, Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian Project, Rust Project, Github, and all those who are involved in providing resources for this build.
